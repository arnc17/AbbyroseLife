With over two decades of teaching experience, she recently earned a promotion to administration and now serves as an assistant principal at a local middle school. Throughout my entire life, she has been an exceptional and caring mother, continuing to provide wonderful support even into my adulthood. Her sense of humor and passion make her a delightful presence, and I cherish having her by my side during significant life events.</p>

                <p>On March 8, 2003, I came into this world in Berkeley, CA, becoming the inaugural addition to my parents, Jessica and Chris. The initial seven years of my life unfolded as an only child until the arrival of my sister, Anagrace, on November 9. Sharing a birthday with my cherished grandmother, who played an essential role in those formative years, added an extra layer of significance to the day. Our family resided in a cozy home in Alameda, CA, where a tight-knit and affectionate community formed through the frequent gatherings of friends and family. These early years were marked by joyous memories that have left a lasting impression on me.</p>

            <div class="summary">
                <p>Throughout my childhood, I was a reserved and introverted individual outside the confines of my home. Despite my quiet demeanor, I engaged enthusiastically in various sports, exploring every option available. Academically, I faced challenges and consistently lagged behind my peers, yet I persisted in giving my best effort to attain success. Over the years, my circle of friends remained a constant, with some coming and going, but a few enduring to this very day. As soon as I was eligible for a work permit, I sought employment, and during high school, I chose a different path, opting to serve as the yearbook editor instead of participating in sports.</p>

Despite encountering difficulties, this period has been transformative, and I've evolved significantly as an individual. I eagerly anticipate what the future holds for me.

                <p>Pasta is my ultimate go-to favorite when it comes to food! I'm not particular about the shape or the sauce – any pasta variation works for me. I have a genuine love for vegetables; they not only enhance my lifestyle but also add a vibrant array of colors to my meals. Interestingly, I used to be an extremely picky eater, limited to just a handful of items. However, with age, I've become more adventurous in my culinary choices, embracing a wide variety of foods and cuisines. Exploring new dishes has become a delightful experience for me. While I appreciate many food groups, it might surprise you to learn that the one I find least appealing is fruit. I'm quite selective, enjoying only about five types. Nevertheless, don't be misled – I am an avid foodie at heart. Whether it's cooking at home or dining out, I relish the entire gastronomic experience.</p>

                <p>I'm not someone with a hectic schedule, juggling a multitude of places to be and tasks to complete. Consequently, I find myself exploring various hobbies that often turn into temporary phases. I've tried my hand at quilting, embroidery, painting, and an assortment of crafts. However, what has truly stuck with me are photography and the joy of cooking or baking (and, if shopping counts, then that too, haha). These are the activities I engage in during my leisure time. When I do manage to carve out a break in my schedule, I prioritize relaxation. Watching movies and TV shows has become my go-to escape. Interestingly, I share many show preferences with my friends, so we often enjoy them together during our free moments.</p>

                <p>I initiated my work journey at the age of 15, right when I became eligible for a work permit. Prior to that, I actively took on babysitting responsibilities for a continuous five years. My first official job was at a local gym in my town, where I served as a soccer coach for toddlers. My role involved teaching them motor skills and ensuring they had a delightful time during early morning sessions on weekends. This continued until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, I redirected my focus towards my education and assumed the position of a yearbook editor. Post-pandemic, I briefly explored the retail sector, but it didn't align well with my preferences and ended shortly. Following that experience, I ventured into substitute para-professional roles at schools in Piedmont and my hometown. I still actively engage in this role whenever I have time off from my studies. Currently, I serve as a student worker on campus at SMC, contributing to administrative tasks and managing social media for the School of Education.</p>

                <p>I proudly embrace my quarter Mexican heritage, a lineage that stems from my mother, who is half-Mexican. Her father's family migrated to the US near the border close to San Diego a few months before my grandfather's birth, making it a significant part of my family history. My grandfather, a central figure in my life, has been instrumental in ensuring that I actively engage in cultural traditions. One cherished tradition is our annual Christmas tamale-making extravaganza, producing around 150 tamales and sometimes even more. During my younger years, I spoke Spanish with my mom's side of the family to cultivate language skills, a practice that, unfortunately, I've lost over time. Nonetheless, I can understand Spanish when spoken to by my family. </p>

                <p>I proudly claim 50 percent Irish heritage, a trait shared by both of my parents who each contribute 50 percent through their genes. Additionally, I carry an Irish last name. The allure of Ireland has always fascinated me, and I've harbored a strong desire to explore the country and immerse myself in its rich culture. Within my family, there's a sense of pride in our Irish roots. I vaguely recall participating in an Irish dancing class as a child, likely without much say in the matter. While Irish heritage is a significant part of my identity percentage-wise, culturally, it may not be the dominant aspect, but it certainly holds a prominent place in my ancestry.</p>

                <p>I proudly carry a quarter Vietnamese heritage, as my mom's father hailed from Vietnam, and interestingly, my dad was born there. On my dad's side, while my grandfather doesn't have an extensive family, my grandmother and her sisters played crucial roles in my upbringing. They took care of me for many years while my parents worked hard to provide for our family.Vietnamese cuisine, especially when prepared at home, holds a special place in my heart and is undoubtedly one of my favorite culinary experiences. I aspire to learn and develop the skill of creating Vietnamese dishes, as my family members possess a remarkable touch in the kitchen. Beyond the culinary delights, small details in everyday life, such as the art in my parents' home and specific rituals observed on certain days of the year, are integral aspects of who I am. While I may not speak the language, the Vietnamese influence remains a significant and meaningful part of my identity.</p>
